Readme
This code will generate a client's federal income for 2018.

Put the client's monthly income into column G and their household
size into column H. This will generate the client's FPL in colummn
K.

This code was originally written for a larger report with more columns, 
which is why it's not using columns A, B, C.

Warning: The code isn't working properly for household sizes >= 9.
