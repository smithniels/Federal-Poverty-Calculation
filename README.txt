Readme
This code will generate a client's federal income for 2019.

Put the client's monthly income into column G and their household
size into column H. This will generate the client's FPL in colummn
K.

This code was originally written for a larger report with more columns, 
which is why a few columns are hidden.

Note: I can't find where the additional amount for additional client is for the 150% poverty line,
      so if a family is at the 9+ size, the calculation isn't working correctly.
